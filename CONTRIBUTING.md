## Style Guides

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
  * 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * ✨ `:sparkles:` when introducing a new feature
  * 🔧 `:wrench:` when changing configuration files
  * ♿ `:wheelchair:` when improving accessibility

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript Style

* Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
* Use semantic HTML5 elements
* Use CSS classes instead of IDs for styling
* Write descriptive variable and function names
* Comment complex logic and functions
* Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
* Use meaningful class names that describe the content, not the presentation
